# Parallel build — Lane 2 report

> Lane 2 of the numbered parallel build (`parallel/lane-2`, worktree `cadence-lane-2`). Identity is the lane NUMBER, not a theme; picks the highest-RANKED free item via `bash scripts/lane.sh next`. Per-cycle loop + rules: [`../../operations/autonomous-build-loop.md`](../../operations/autonomous-build-loop.md) §15-16; lane-local config: `.remember/LANE.md` (git-ignored). This file is the run log; the master status board is [`../feature-dashboard.md`](../feature-dashboard.md).

## 2026-06-22 — DBR-3f: shared-premise precedent (DBR multi-hop, graph-over-vectors)

**Picked:** `DBR (H1)` (`lane.sh next` rank 3; ranks 1-2 WM-M15/WM-M9 are chokepoint-pinned / attended → skipped inline). Claimed the register row atomically and **held** it for the increment.

**Shipped (◐ dormant-correct):** the multi-hop graph-over-vectors query the decision-brain evidence table names but had never been built — "what happened the last time a decision rested on the SAME upstream premise as this one?" Walks the DERIVATION graph UP to the decision's premise ancestors, then back DOWN to their other descendants (cousins sharing a premise off the target's own path), and reports each cousin PRD's recorded outcome (missed-first). Distinct from DBR-2/3, which walk the supersedes/contradicts reversal edges.

- New PURE `src/lib/ai/shared-premise.ts` (two-directional walk + outcome-ranked selection + Critic block; 21 tests incl. a depth-complete subtree-exclusion regression).
- New `src/lib/ai/shared-premise.server.ts` (two bounded, fail-safe BFS closures via one column-parameterized helper + a `prds.outcome` join).
- Wired an independent fail-safe `sharedPremise` block + guidance into `runCritic` (`src/lib/ai/critic.server.ts`).

**Adversarial review:** 3-lens Workflow (correctness / runtime-safety / over-claim) = **unanimous SHIP, 0 blockers, 0 must-fix.** Folded 3 cheap real improvements: depth-complete subtree exclusion; honesty-softened block framing; symmetric `.limit` on the outcomes query. Tenancy proven clean (user_id-filtered closures; RLS-scoped `prds` read; UUID-gated ids).

**Gate:** tsc 0 / 21 shared-premise tests / **1102 full suite** / no em/en-dash in generated strings. Byte-identical + fail-safe until derivation edges + recorded outcomes both exist.

**State:** committed + fast-forward pushed to `origin/main`. `DBR (H1)` claim **HELD** (heartbeat) for the next increment (next: extend the same resolver to the proactive precedent nudge, mirroring DBR-3b's Critic → nudge fan-out). Docs: `decision-brain.md` (DBR-3f), dashboard row (Increment 8), `plan.md` §4.
