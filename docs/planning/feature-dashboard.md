# Feature Dashboard - the single live status board (master sheet)

> **What this is.** The one canonical, at-a-glance status of **every** feature: what is built, in development, paused, deferred, or pending, each with a one-line "why it matters" and a build cue so any session can pick it up cold. This is the **front door** to status. Detail lives elsewhere (links below); this page is the index that stays true.
>
> **Last updated:** 2026-06-16 · **Maintainer rule:** Tier 1, continuous (update in the same commit as any status change).

---

## ⛔ STANDING RULE - read this BEFORE starting any feature work (non-negotiable)

Every tool (Claude Code · Antigravity · Gemini · Lovable · a future session) **must** do this before touching any feature:

1. **`git pull origin main`**, then **read this dashboard.** It is checked before any activity starts, exactly so a new or parallel session knows what is already in flight or already deferred and does not collide or redo.
2. **Respect the claims.** If a row is `🔨 In Dev`, another session may be on it - do not start it. Pick a different row, or coordinate. Check the **Active claims** table below first.
3. **On pickup:** flip that row's status to `🔨 In Dev (<tool>, YYYY-MM-DD)`, add a line to the **Active claims** table, and commit + push immediately so others see the claim. Same commit, before you write feature code.
4. **On completion:** flip the row to `✅ (YYYY-MM-DD · <commit>)`, remove the Active-claims line, and update the linked detail doc + `plan.md` §4 in the same unit of work (the closed-doc loop).
5. **On pause/defer/block:** flip to `⏸️`, `⏭️`, or `🚧` with a one-line reason in the row.

> This is the same shared-cursor discipline as the Live status board in [`feature-backlog.md`](./feature-backlog.md); this page is the human-readable master view of it. When they disagree, fix both in the same commit.

### How to pick something up
Say **"pick `<ID>`"** (e.g. "pick I-2", "start K1", "do F-IA-V4") and the agent resolves the ID here → reads the **Cue** → opens the linked detail → builds. The IDs are stable and shared with [`feature-backlog.md`](./feature-backlog.md) and [`v7-build-status.md`](./v7-build-status.md).

### Status legend
| Mark | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ | **Done** - built, on `main`, verified (date · commit where known) |
| 🔨 | **In Development** - actively being built this/another session (see Active claims) |
| ◐ | **Partial** - foundation built, real remaining work; row says what's left |
| ⏸️ | **Paused** - started or built but intentionally idle, with a reason |
| ⏭️ | **Deferred** - deliberately not now (gate/sequence reason) |
| 🚧 | **Blocked** - cannot proceed until a dependency clears (often a `KI-` or a founder action) |
| ⬜ | **Pending** - not started, ready to pick up |
| ⚠️ | **Verify** - docs conflict on whether this is done; confirm against the live build before acting |

---

## Active claims (who is on what, right now)

> Keep this table empty when nothing is in flight. Add a row the moment you pick something up.

| ID | Feature | Tool / session | Since | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B5 | Archive / delete product (soft archive + hard delete w/ export) | Claude Code (IA/cockpit lane) | 2026-06-17 | Full product lifecycle on the `/product` **Portfolio** (B3 continuation): soft archive + restore (reversible, Undo toast), JSON export (escape hatch), honest export-then-delete (typed-name confirm; copy reflects FK `on delete set null` — delete detaches signals/opps/specs to the workspace, doesn't destroy them). `projects.functions.ts` + `_authenticated.product.tsx` + `archived_at` migration. Collision-free: NOT AppShell (which has only the bare sidebar delete). |

> ✅ **G3 Build → QA → Ship complete (2026-06-16):** I3 · J1 · J2 · I1 · I1b · K1 · I2 all ✅. Build is a Cursor-grade hero (live cockpit + Phase-2 polish). The remaining build frontier is the sandbox/preview spine (v8 Phase 3) + delegate-out. IA/cockpit lanes (N3, F-TODAY-LOOPPULSE, E8) in/landed.

The engine (Sense → Decide → Plan, memory, governance) is **built and verified live**. The pending frontier is the **execution half** of the lifecycle (Build → QA → Ship → Launch → Learn), **monetization/PLG**, and **interop/team**. Milestone narrative: [`v7-build-status.md`](./v7-build-status.md) (M-0 to M-D).

| P1-AA | Deterministic auto-advance | ✅ | Missions advance unattended past wave 0 | `src/lib/ai/mission-advance.server.ts` |
| P1-RETRY | Bounded hop retry | ✅ | A failed hop retries with backoff, not a dead mission | `src/lib/ai/retry.ts` |
| P1-BUDGET | Adaptive step budget | ✅ | Step budget scales to role/arc, not a static cap | `src/lib/ai/budget.ts` |
| W1 | Memory-compounding loop | ✅ | Outcomes distil into recallable memory across agents (the moat wired) | `src/lib/ai/outcome-memory.ts` |

## G1 - Sense & Discovery
_Get real signal in, cluster it, keep it fresh._

| ID | Feature | Status | Why it matters / what it delivers | Cue / detail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KI-10 | Ingest webhook + per-token rate limit | ✅ (2026-06-16) | One secure live ingest path for public use | [`features/ingest-webhook.md`](../features/ingest-webhook.md) |
| F-BRAIN | Brain (web + workspace research) | ✅ | Perplexity-grade research feeding decisions | [`features/brain.md`](../features/brain.md) |
| F-CONN | Connector platform (OAuth) | ⏸️ Parked | The connector engine is built; **parked** pending founder OAuth-client registration | `src/lib/connectors/` · [`architecture/integrations.md`](../../architecture/integrations.md) |
| SEN-01 | Connector dock: 2nd live ingest (Slack / GitHub issues / support) | ⬜ (M-A) | The loop needs ≥2 real sources to close on real data | Register one provider OAuth client → adapter in `src/lib/connectors/` |
| F3 | Continuous discovery feed | ◐ Partial | Always-fresh per-product feed + incremental re-cluster (Scout ingest is manual today) | Extend discovery functions; feed UI on `/prds` discovery |
| N2 | Re-score + insight memo + daily brief | ✅ (2026-06-16) | Re-score loop + daily brief already existed; this added the missing **insight memo** — the daily brief now ingests the recent `learnings` (re-scored outcomes: verdict + summary + ICE shift) and synthesizes a "what the loop learned" beat. ⚠️ Wiring + build verified; the AI-generated brief output needs a live re-verify on the deployed app (local dev has no AI key) | `copilot.functions.ts` (`ensureTodayBrief`) → Today's brief |
| O1 | Knowledge graph + query | ⬜ | Typed signals→themes→opps→decisions→outcomes; "why is this on the roadmap?" | New graph tables + query fn |
| O3 | Fact currency/drift + skill packs | ⬜ | Flag stale facts; export versioned skill bundles over MCP | Depends on O1 + Q1 |
| SEN-04 | Researcher watchtower (competitor crawl briefs) | ⬜ (M2) | Ambient competitive signal without manual research | Firecrawl crawl + scheduled brief |
| SEN-05 | Quant analytics inbound (PostHog/Amplitude/Mixpanel) | ⬜ (M2) | Product metrics as first-class signal | Connector adapter + `product_analytics` |
| F-AUDIO-1 | Speech transcription + chunking | ⬜ | Upload meeting audio → transcript → diarized chunks | Whisper pipeline + storage |
| F-AUDIO-2 | Action-item / ticket extraction from transcripts | ⬜ | Meetings become drafted opportunities/PRDs citing the transcript | Depends on F-AUDIO-1 |

## G2 - Decide & Plan
_Turn signal into governed decisions and specs._

| ID | Feature | Status | Why it matters / what it delivers | Cue / detail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F-CHAT-NL-INTENT | Conversational command of the swarm | ✅ | Drive missions in natural language | `src/routes/api/chat.ts` |
| H1 | PRD / spec generation | ✅ (2026-06-14) | Cited specs from opportunities | discovery/lineage functions |
| DEF-03 | Critic-on-spec red team | ✅ (2026-06-14) | Specs get an adversarial pass before commit | Critic inline call |
| F-DEC-CARD | Decision card + Critic badge on Today | ✅ | The human makes the call with the Critic's view in front of them | Today surface |
| F-SHARE | Shareable-decision viral loop + rate limit | ✅ (2026-06-16) | A public decision link drives signups; secure anon-read | [`features/shareable-decisions.md`](../features/shareable-decisions.md) |
| H2 | Outcome roadmap (Now/Next/Later) | ✅ (2026-06-17) | Outcome-driven board on `/product?tab=roadmap`: the human commits opportunities to Now/Next/Later with a declared outcome + measure; the agent's continuous ICE ranking orders within each bucket (NOT the v6-deleted task kanban). Native HTML5 drag + a keyboard/click bucket select per card; verified RLS-scoped writes (user-scoped `.select()` so a blocked update fails loudly). Adversarially reviewed: 3 fixes (phantom-ok write, a11y drag-only gap, field reset). **Place-into-bucket write is gated on the next Lovable sync applying the migration; read is pre-migration tolerant.** | `roadmap.functions.ts` + `RoadmapBoard.tsx` + migration `20260617000000_h2_roadmap_outcome.sql` |
| H3 | Scheduling (calendar-aware work blocks) | ✅ (2026-06-16) | "Plan deep work" on the Calendar: `proposeWorkBlocks` schedules open deep-work tasks into free time within working hours (reuses proposeSlots' conflict logic; one block per task, back-to-back, skips weekends/meetings; pure read-only proposal), each block has "Add to calendar". Adversarially reviewed: 1 real boundary bug + a user-facing em-dash fixed | `calendar.functions.ts` (`proposeWorkBlocks`) + `CalendarPanel.tsx` |
| D4 | Cancellation / replay-and-branch / checkpoints | ⬜ | Stop mid-run, re-run with a different model/prompt, diff the result | Mission control + loop checkpoints |

## G3 - Build → QA → Ship (the autonomous execution chain)
_The biggest pending block and the core differentiator: genuine end-to-end execution. Some of this exists via the Build engine (F-STUDIO); verify overlap before building._

| ID | Feature | Status | Why it matters / what it delivers | Cue / detail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F-STUDIO | Build engine (repo reads, multi-file changesets, `studio/*` branches, PR + CI, gated merge) | ✅ | The green path that ships real code | [`features/studio.md`](../features/studio.md) |
| I1 | Studio multi-file coding (per-hunk accept/reject) | ✅ (2026-06-16) | Operator can curate a staged changeset before the gated commit: per-hunk reject (reverts to base) + drop a whole file. Pure tested diff engine shared UI/server | `ai/studio-hunks.ts` (11 tests) + `studio.functions.ts` (applyStagedHunkSelection / rejectStagedFile) + `ChangesPanel.tsx` |
| I1b | True revision history (atomic revisions) | ✅ (2026-06-16) | Each `studio.commit` records a revision (no, sha, message, files); the Changes tab shows the commit history with GitHub links. Revert-to-revision deferred (needs per-revision content or git ops) | migration `20260616230000` + `registry.server.ts` studio.commit + `getChangesetRevisions` + `ChangesPanel` strip |
| I2 | Watch-the-agents-build live surface | ✅ (2026-06-16) | Live per-session cockpit: 4s conditional polling, two-pane (timeline+steer / Changes·PR·Cost), journey strip, inline approval gates, merge gate, cost. Phase-2 polish added a live "what's it doing now" caption (outcome-named, no tool-id leak) + calmer copy. True SSE streaming deferred (nice-to-have) | `_authenticated.build.{index,$missionId}.tsx` + `SessionTimeline.tsx` |
| I3 | Branch/worktree isolation per mission | ✅ (2026-06-16) | Concurrent missions can't share a branch or clobber files: per-path `builder_file_claims` (same-file guard) + collision-safe per-changeset branch `studio/<mission8>-<changeset12>` + clean open→squash-merge→release path. Git Data API (no local checkout), so "worktree" = isolated branch | `ai/studio-branch.ts` (6 tests) + `registry.server.ts` studio.commit |
| J1 | Test generation + run | ✅ (2026-06-16) | Studio agent now authors tests as part of every change (prompt discipline); tests run in the connected repo's GitHub Actions CI (no Cadence sandbox, by design) | migration `20260616220000` (Studio system prompt) |
| J2 | QA gate + self-correct loop | ✅ (2026-06-16) | `studio.pr.merge` now refuses to merge while CI is red or pending (Cadence-level gate, not just GitHub required-checks); with the J1 prompt directing fix-on-red-until-green, the self-correct loop closes | `ai/studio-ci.ts` (12 tests) + `registry.server.ts` studio.pr.merge |
| K1 | Release notes for a shipped changeset | ✅ (2026-06-16) | Generate/regenerate factual release notes from a changeset (files + commit revisions + linked work order) via the AI chokepoint (auto-humanized), persisted on the changeset + shown in the Changes tab. PR/merge gates already exist (studio.pr.*, J2 CI-gated); deploy stays external. Note: owner-scoped generation (changeset RLS) | migration `20260616240000` + `generateReleaseNotes` + `ChangesPanel` section |
| K1-deploy | Cadence-triggered deploy gate | ⏭️ Deferred | Triggering the actual deploy from Cadence needs a Cloudflare/Lovable deploy hook + founder config; deploy is external today. Deferred (founder ruling: honest path, no speculative infra) | needs a deploy hook + token |
| K2 | Rollback triggers + one-action revert | ⬜ | Safe ship: documented rollback, feature-flag kill, UI revert | Revert path + flag kill |
| BLD-05 | Inspector gate (agent tests + preview before merge) | ⬜ | A preview + test bar before a merge proposal reaches you | Depends on J1/J2 |
| F-BUILDER-MULTIFILE | Scoped multi-file build (pre-declared touch list, max N files) | ⬜ | Thin slice of I1; safer multi-file edits | `studio.functions.ts` claims |
| BLD-04 | Delegate-out to external coding agents under governance | ⬜ (M4) | A2A-style hand-off of build work, still governed | Depends on Q2 |

| M1 / LRN-01 | Support triage loop (tickets → drafted replies → bug clusters → signals) | ⬜ (M2) | Support feeds back into Discover; the loop closes | Inbound channel + Analyst learn loop |
| LRN-02 | Outcome reviews (predicted vs actual, Historian verdicts) | ⬜ | Honest scorekeeping that trains the next decision | Outcome tables + review fn |
| F-ANALYTICS-1 | Cohort metrics + telemetry ingestion → `product_analytics` | ⬜ | Released features get real usage data | Depends on SEN-05 |
| F-ANALYTICS-2 | Opportunity impact eval (post-release cohort → Product Memory → auto-ICE) | ⬜ | The loop learns whether a bet paid off | Depends on F-ANALYTICS-1 |
| N3 | Mission Compounding View ("referenced N prior decisions") | ✅ (2026-06-16) | Makes the moat visible per mission: "drew on N prior memories" + the lineage (each memory + which agent cited it) + a copy-snapshot export; deduped across per-hop recalls + handoff `memory_refs` | `_authenticated.missions.$missionId.tsx` (`MissionCompounding`, client-side from `getMission` — no new server fn needed) |

| M-C-EXPIRY | Memory-expiry enforcement engine | ⏸️ Dormant | Free memory expiry is built but gated **off** (`memory_expiry_enabled()`); flip on when monetizing | migration `20260616210000` |
| PLG | PLG funnel (public onboarding → first-win → upgrade) | ⬜ | Turns share-link traffic into activated, paying users | Public onboarding + W6 |
| W6 | Persona onboarding tracks (Solo / Founding PM / Tech Founder) | ⬜ (P0) | Per-track sample data + first-mission + first-win moment | Onboarding flow + seed data |

| Q2 | A2A server/client + Agent Cards + scopes/audit (external) | ⬜ (M-D) | Peer agents discover and call us, governed | Extend A2A card + scopes |
| A6 / ENG-08 | Roles + RBAC + invites (owner/admin/member/viewer) | ⬜ (M-D) | Teams can actually use it together; per-persona approval lanes | Membership tables + RLS roles |

## Status reconciliation note
Statuses here are reconciled from [`v7-build-status.md`](./v7-build-status.md) (milestone tags), [`../../active-task.md`](../../active-task.md) (latest shipped/dormant/parked detail), and [`feature-backlog.md`](./feature-backlog.md) (granular ledger). Where those docs conflict on a "done" claim, the row is marked **⚠️ Verify** rather than assumed - confirm against the live build before building. **The four ⚠️-Verify rows from the first cut were reconciled against the live code on 2026-06-16 (with file:line evidence): DEC-02 confirmed Done; FND-0.7, I1, and J2 confirmed Partial, with the specific remaining work noted in each row.** Granular acceptance criteria and "How to use / verify" blocks live in [`feature-backlog.md`](./feature-backlog.md); milestone exit criteria live in [`v7-build-status.md`](./v7-build-status.md); open bugs live in [`known-issues.md`](./known-issues.md).
